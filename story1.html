   <p>After his initial training in education, Jean-Marie worked as a secondary school teacher. He switched to media production following training in Belgium and in France. Unfortunately, the horrors of wars throughout his African great lakes home region curtailed his promising young career.
 
</p>Jean-Marie was determined to carry on the media path after he escaped the genocide in Rwanda and resettle in Canada in 1994. He earned a certificate in journalism.
He went on to work at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC-RadioCanada) and Radio Canada international.

     <h4>HELLO ED TECH!</h4>
<div class="comtmt">       
   <span class="dtrm">
Jean-Marie set out on his Educational Technology (Ed Tech) journey during the heydays of the Internet bubble. The new information and communication technologies' revolution was promising the century-old discipline a thorough facelift.
As a conseiquence, the traditional bricks and mortar educational and training facilities were bracing for oblivion.

Jean-Marie readily embraced Ed Tech. This promising multidisciplinary field looked like a timely crucible in which he could blend his educational and media backgrounds in order to forge a sturdy expertise in the emerging forward-looking technology-based teaching and training approaches. He dusted off his bachelor degree in Education and completed, one after the other, a Masters and Doctoral degree in Educational Technology. He went on to work as an instructional designer and education specialist with higher education, government and non-governmental Canadian institutions in Canada and in Africa. 

<p>An avid learner, always on the lookout for improvement in his fast-paced field, Jean-Marie has recently felt the need to update his technology skills. He registered in an online program in web technologies. Turning the tables, switching from his previous instructional designer's to an online student's seat proved to be a highly instructive as well as a sobering experience.
In addition to improving his technological skills, it shed a light on Ed Tech's "Two Solitudes". The experience gave him an empirical understanding of the opportunities and the challenges of online learning.

<h4>THE TWO SOLITUDES</h4>
